[#admin-adminpanel-system-users]
= Users

The users interface can be accessed by clicking on the "Users" navigation item on the left navigation drawer under the system item group.

**A user** is someone who can log in to the {PRODUCT_NAME} system.

Each user has Email, Full name and Nickname (handle).
Additionally, each user has a username (=email) and password to enable them to log in to the system (referred as credentials).

The interface allows you to:

* Edit permissions regarding the user resource (see <<admin-adminpanel-system-users-perms>>),
* add new users (see <<admin-adminpanel-system-users-add>>),
* list system users (see <<admin-adminpanel-system-users-list>>),
* edit users (see <<admin-adminpanel-system-users-edit>>).

[#admin-adminpanel-system-users-perms]

====
The ability to manage the visibility of emails and names was introduced with the user masking privacy feature.
It allows a specific role to know about other users but they can't necessarily know of their private information.
