= Roles

The roles interface can be accessed by clicking on the "Roles" navigation item on the left navigation drawer under the system item group.

**A role** defines a user group with a specific set of permissions on the resources.

* add new role (see <<admin-adminpanel-system-roles-add>>),
* list roles (see <<admin-adminpanel-system-roles-list>>),
